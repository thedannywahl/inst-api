    insthelp - https://instructure.com

SYNOPSIS
    insthelp method [options]

DESCRIPTION
    insthelp is a collection of helper functions for the inst-api suite. insthelp does not directly do anything itself and is only useful when called from a source command.  However, all methods can be called directly and will print their output to the console.

METHOD
    The method is the name of the function to be executed by insthelp.

    NULL
      if no method is passed to insthelp basic version information is printed to the console.

    checkdeps
      checkdeps verifies that all the system dependencies for inst-API are installed on the system.  checkdeps can attempt to install some dependencies.

    curlopts
      curlopts will determine the highest supported version of TLS on the client, and will return option flags to be used by the curl command.

    help <command>
      help prints basic usage info to the console for the source command.

    license
      license prints the inst-api license to the console.

    readconfig <command>
      readconfig sources and returns the configuration details from the configuration file (~/.inst) for the source command.

    setconfig <command>
      setconfig saves configuration details for the source command to the configuration file (~/.inst).

    setoutput <download> <file> [call]
      setoutput builds an output file path and name for the return of the source command and returns it.

      the download parameter is a boolean flag.

      setoutput will automatically generate safe filenames based on API methods and an epoch timestamp then output them as JSON when a directory is passed. Example:

      insthelp setoutput false ~/Desktop/ "path/to/resource"
      ~/Desktop/path_to_resource_1562961260.json

      However, a full filename can be passed and it will be respected. Additionally, it is not required to pass the API method in this case. Example:

      insthelp setoutput false ~Desktop/important.txt
      ~/Desktop/important.txt

      setoutput will not attempt to create directories.  It will prompt a user asking to overwrite an existing file.

    setquery [params]

      setquery parses URL parameters and returns either a '?' or an '&' to the source command.

    setrenderer [renderer]
      setrenderer takes a renderer input from the source command and returns the renderer to be used by the console.

    verbosehelp <command>
      verbosehelp prints the full help documentation for the source command to the console.

    version <command> <version>
      version prints the version number and a sweet ASCII logo of the source command to the console.
