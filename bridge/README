NAME
    bridge - https://www.getbridge.com/

SYNOPSIS
    bridge [options] method

DESCRIPTION
    bridge-cli is a secure curl wrapper designed to simplify interacting
    with the bridge JSON/REST API.

    bridge-cli automatically authenticates users based on credentials stored
    in the config file or on values passed at runtime.

OPTIONS
    Options start with a single dash and many options require
    a value after them.

    All of the options are optional, however, some require
    that other options be set as well for example
    -d <domain> also requires -t <token> and vice versa.

    All options must be included before the API method.

    -c
        This option runs the bridge configuration and stores the
        domain, email, and password in the preference file
        located at ~/.inst

        If no preference file is detected on first run, the
        configuration process will automatically run.  This option
        is mainly for adding bridge if other Instructure APIs have
        already been used, such as arc or bridge

        bridge config stores the following values in ~/.inst:
        bridge_domain="<domain>"
        bridge_token="<token>"


    -d <domain>
        This option allows querying a specified domain,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        The value only requires the subdomain string of
        bridgeapp.com.  E.g. if the desired domain to query
        is https://foobar.bridgeapp.com then pass the option
        "-d foobar"

        -d also requires that -t <token> be included
        in the query.  bridge will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -F <name=content>
        The Form option transparently passes to curl.  Please read
        the curl documentation regarding the use of the Form option.

    -h
        Usage help.  This lists all the available options with
        descriptions and examples.

    -l
        License information.

    -o <path>
        This option outputs the return to a specified path and file.

        When an output is specified, bridge will always set the output
        rendered to "plain", even if it is explicitly specified.

    -r <renderer>
        This option allows you to specify the render method of the
        the return from bridge.  Available options are:

        "color" (default) This will use json (npm) to format the
        return and will use pygmentize (pip) to color the return.

        "plain" This option will return the raw JSON object unformatted.

        Plain is always used when when -o <path> is used, even if color
        is explicitly specified in the command.

    -t <token>
        This option allows querying with a specified login password,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        -t also requires that -d <domain> be included
        in the query.  bridge will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -X <HTTP method>
        This option specifies the request method to be used by
        the command.  Available options are:

        "GET"/"get" (default)
        "POST"/"post"
        "PUT"/"put"
        "DELETE"/"delete"

        The required HTTP method is generally specified in the bridge
        API documentation.

    -v
        Version information.

METHOD
    The method is the URL path to be queried, excluding the
    domain, subdomain and, /api/ path.

    For example if the desired query is:
    https://<domain>.bridgeapp.com/api/learner/courses
    The method is simply:
    learner/courses

    The method can be quoted without issue in the event that
    the current shell has issues with query parameters.
    For example when searching for users you can use:

    bridge "learner/courses?as_user_id=<user_id>"

EXAMPLES
    Download a data dump
        bridge -o ~/data.zip admin/data_dumps/download

    Get plain format for a specified report
        bridge -r plain admin/reports/<report_id>

    Save output of list of author-affiliated sub accounts
        bridge -o ~/affiliated.json author/affiliated_sub_accounts

    Masquerade as a specified user
        bridge learner/courses?as_user_id=<user_id>

    Delete a specified enrollment
        bridge -X DELETE /api/author/enrollments/<enrollment_id>

    Publish a course
        bridge -X POST author/course_templates/<course_id>/publish

    Authenticate to bridge without using .inst config file
        bridge -d <domain> -t <token> learner/courses
