SYNOPSIS
    canvas [options] method

DESCRIPTION
    canvas-cli is a secure curl wrapper designed to simplify interacting
    with the canvas JSON/REST API.

    canvas-cli automatically authenticates users based on credentials stored
    in the config file or on values passed at runtime.

OPTIONS
    Options start with a single dash and many options require
    a value after them.

    All of the options are optional, however, some require
    that other options be set as well for example
    -d <domain> also requires -t <token> and vice versa.

    All options must be included before the API method.

    -c
        This option runs the canvas configuration and stores the
        domain, email, and password in the preference file
        located at ~/.inst

        If no preference file is detected on first run, the
        configuration process will automatically run.  This option
        is mainly for adding canvas if other Instructure APIs have
        already been used, such as arc or canvas

        canvas config stores the following values in ~/.inst:
        canvas_domain="<domain>"
        canvas_token="<token>"


    -d <domain>
        This option allows querying a specified domain,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        The value only requires the subdomain string of
        instructure.com.  E.g. if the desired domain to query
        is https://foobar.instructure.com then pass the option
        "-d foobar"

        -d also requires that -t <token> be included
        in the query.  canvas will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -F <name=content>
        The Form option transparently passes to curl.  Please read
        the curl documentation regarding the use of the Form option.

    -h
        Usage help.  This lists all the available options with
        descriptions and examples.

    -l
        License information.

    -o <path>
        This option outputs the return to a specified path and file.

        When an output is specified, canvas will always set the output
        rendered to "plain", even if it is explicitly specified.

    -r <renderer>
        This option allows you to specify the render method of the
        the return from canvas.  Available options are:

        "color" (default) This will use json (npm) to format the
        return and will use pygmentize (pip) to color the return.

        "plain" This option will return the raw JSON object unformatted.

        Plain is always used when when -o <path> is used, even if color
        is explicitly specified in the command.

    -t <token>
        This option allows querying with a specified login password,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        -t also requires that -d <domain> be included
        in the query.  canvas will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -X <HTTP method>
        This option specifies the request method to be used by
        the command.  Available options are:

        "GET"/"get" (default)
        "POST"/"post"
        "PUT"/"put"
        "DELETE"/"delete"

        The required HTTP method is generally specified in the canvas
        API documentation.

    -v
        Version information.

METHOD
    The method is the URL path to be queried, excluding the
    domain, subdomain and, /api/v1/ path.

    For example if the desired query is:
    https://<domain>.instructure.com/api/v1/courses
    The method is simply:
    courses

    The method can be quoted without issue in the event that
    the current shell has issues with query parameters.
    For example when searching for users you can use:

    canvas "courses?as_user_id=<user_id>"

EXAMPLES
    Get a user profile
        canvas users/<user_id>

    Get plain format list of rubrics for a specified account
        canvas -r plain /api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/rubrics

    Save output of submissions for a specified assignmnet
        canvas -o ~/submissions.json \
        courses/<course_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>/submissions

    Masquerade as a specified user
        canvas courses?as_user_id=<user_id>

    Delete a specified enrollment
        canvas -X DELETE /api/author/enrollments/<enrollment_id>

    Edit a specified assignment
        canvas -X PUT -F "assignment[name]=foobar" \
        <course_id>/assignments/<assignment_id>

    Authenticate to canvas without using .inst config file
        canvas -d <domain> -t <token> courses
