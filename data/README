NAME
    cdata - https://instructure.com/canvas

SYNOPSIS
    cdata [options] method

DESCRIPTION
    canvas-data-cli is a secure curl wrapper designed to simplify interacting
    with the canvas data JSON/REST API.

    canvas-data-cli automatically authenticates users based on credentials stored
    in the config file or on values passed at runtime.

OPTIONS
    Options start with a single dash and many options require
    a value after them.

    All of the options are optional, however, some require
    that other options be set as well for example
    -d <domain> also requires -t <token> and vice versa.

    All options must be included before the API method.

    -a
        This option retrieves dumps only after the specified
        sequence number.

    -c
        This option runs the canvas data configuration and stores the
        key, and secret in the preference file located at ~/.inst

        If no preference file is detected on first run, the
        configuration process will automatically run.  This option
        is mainly for adding canvas if other Instructure APIs have
        already been used, such as studio or canvas.

        cdata config stores the following values in ~/.inst:
        data_secret="<secret>"
        data_key="<key>"

    -d
        Download referenced dumps in the response.

        -d also requires that -o <path> be included in the query.

    -h
        Usage help.  This lists all the available options with
        descriptions and examples.

    -k
        This option allows you to pass a canvas data key instead of
        using one stored in the config file.

        -k also requires that -m <secret> be included in the query.
        cdata will not allow you to pass one authentication parameter
        and read the others from config.

    -l
        License information.

    -m
        This option allows you to pass a canvas data secret instead of
        using one stored in the config file.

        -m also requires that -k <key> be included in the query.
        cdata will not allow you to pass one authentication parameter
        and read the others from config.

    -o <path>
        This option outputs the return to a specified path and/or file.

        When used with -d the path must be a directory.

        When an output is specified, cdata will always set the output
        rendered to "plain", even if it is explicitly specified.

    -q <quantity>
        This option allows you to set the limit value of the number
        of dumps to retrieve. The default is 50 if this is not set.

        When performing multiple queries it is recommended to set -q <quantity>
        to a higher value to avoid being rate limited.

    -r <renderer>
        This option allows you to specify the render method of the
        the return from canvas.  Available options are:

        "color" (default) This will use json (npm) to format the
        return and will use pygmentize (pip) to color the return.

        "plain" This option will return the raw JSON object unformatted.

        Plain is always used when when -o <path> is used, even if color
        is explicitly specified in the command.

    -s
        This command will output the complete curl command in a readable
        format.  It will not execute the command.

    -v
        Version information.

METHOD
    The method is the URL path to be queried, excluding the
    domain, subdomain and, /api/account/self/ path.

    For example if the desired query is:
    https://portal.inshosteddata.com/api/account/self/dump
    The method is simply:
    dump

    The method can be quoted without issue in the event that
    the current shell has issues with query parameters.
    For example when filtering dumps you can use:

    cdata "dump?after=<integer>&limit=<integer>"

EXAMPLES
    Get the latest schema
        cdata schema/latest

    Get plain format list of files for a specified table
        cdata -r plain file/byTable/wiki_page_fact

    Save output of dumps for a specified quantity
        cdata -o ~/dumps.json -q 2 dump

    Authenticate to cdata without using .inst config file
        cdata -m <secret> -k <key> files/latest

    Download the latest dump files
        cdata -o <path> -d files/latest

FILES
    ~/.inst
        Config file, see -c for details.
