SYNOPSIS
    catalog [options] method

DESCRIPTION
    catalog-cli is a secure curl wrapper designed to simplify interacting
    with the catalog JSON/REST API.

    catalog-cli automatically authenticates users based on credentials stored
    in the config file or on values passed at runtime.

OPTIONS
    Options start with a single dash and many options require
    a value after them.

    All of the options are optional, however, some require
    that other options be set as well for example
    -d <domain> also requires -t <token> and vice versa.

    All options must be included before the API method.

    -a
        This option gets all pages of results for the specified
        method.  By default only the first page is queried.

    -c
        This option runs the catalog configuration and stores the
        domain, email, and password in the preference file
        located at ~/.inst

        If no preference file is detected on first run, the
        configuration process will automatically run.  This option
        is mainly for adding catalog if other Instructure APIs have
        already been used, such as arc or canvas

        catalog config stores the following values in ~/.inst:
        catalog_domain="<domain>"
        catalog_token="<token>"

    -d <domain>
        This option allows querying a specified domain,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        The value only requires the subdomain string of
        catalogapp.com.  E.g. if the desired domain to query
        is https://foobar.catalog.instructure.com then pass the option
        "-d foobar"

        -d also requires that -t <token> be included
        in the query.  catalog will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -F <name=content>
        The Form option transparently passes to curl.  Please read
        the curl documentation regarding the use of the Form option.

    -h
        Usage help.  This lists all the available options with
        descriptions and examples.

    -l
        License information.

    -o <path>
        This option outputs the return to a specified path and file.

        When an output is specified, catalog will always set the output
        rendered to "plain", even if it is explicitly specified.

    -p <page>
        This option allows you to query starting at a specific page.
        For example -p 2 will start at page 2.  This defaults to
        page 1 if not set.  This can be used with the all option. For
        example -a -p 3 will query all results, starting with page 3.

        This option only works when the httpmethod (-X) is set to "GET"

    -q <quantity>
        This option allows you to set the per_page value of the query.
        The default is 10 if this is not set.  The max value is 100, if
        a value greater than 100 is selected, this will revert to 100.
        This option will affect the numer of pages returned or the values
        returned by the -a or -p <page> option.  For example, if there are
        100 records by default -a will return 10 pages of results.  If the
        option is set to -q 50 then only 2 pages of results will be returned.

        When performing multiple queries it is recommended to set -q <quantity>
        to a higher value to avoid being rate limited.

        This option only works when the httpmethod (-X) is set to "GET"

    -r <renderer>
        This option allows you to specify the render method of the
        the return from catalog.  Available options are:

        "color" (default) This will use json (npm) to format the
        return and will use pygmentize (pip) to color the return.

        "plain" This option will return the raw JSON object unformatted.

        Plain is always used when when -o <path> is used, even if color
        is explicitly specified in the command.

    -s
        This command will output the complete curl command in a readable
        format.  It will not execute the command.

    -t <token>
        This option allows querying with a specified login password,
        overriding the value set in the .inst config file.

        -t also requires that -d <domain> be included
        in the query.  catalog will not allow you to pass one
        authentication parameter and read the others from config.

    -X <HTTP method>
        This option specifies the request method to be used by
        the command.  Available options are:

        "GET"/"get" (default)
        "POST"/"post"
        "PUT"/"put"
        "DELETE"/"delete"

        The required HTTP method is generally specified in the catalog
        API documentation.

    -v
        Version information.

METHOD
    The method is the URL path to be queried, excluding the
    domain, subdomain and, /api/ path.

    For example if the desired query is:
    https://<domain>.catalog.instructure.com/api/v1/courses
    The method is simply:
    courses

    The method can be quoted without issue in the event that
    the current shell has issues with query parameters.
    For example when searching for users you can use:

    catalog "courses?per_page=40"

EXAMPLES
    Get the list of courses
        catalog courses

    Get plain format for the list of catalogs
        catalog -r plain catalogs

    Save output of list of enrollments for a specified course
        catalog -o ~/enrollments.json -F "listing_id=<course_id>" enrollments

    List additional results (default 20, max 100)
        catalog -q <integer> courses

    Delete a specific program
        catalog -X DELETE programs/<program_id>

    Update a specific program
        catalog -X PUT -F "program[title]=<title>" programs/<program_id>

    Authenticate to catalog without using .inst config file
        catalog -d <domain> -t <token> courses

    Get all the courses for a user, 50 courses per page
        catalog -a -q 50 courses
